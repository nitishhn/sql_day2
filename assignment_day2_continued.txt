1. What is Views in MySql?  Why do we use Views? How to create views in MySql?
-> 
In MySQL, views are virtual tables that represent the result set of a SELECT query. They are not storedas a part of the database schema like physical tables.
 instead, they are dynamically generated each time they are queried.
There are several reasons why we use views in mySQL :
1. They help in simplyfying complex queries
2. code reusablity
3. Enhanced security
4. Performance optimisation
5. Abstraction od Data model changes

Syntax to create views in mySQL is :

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

2.  Create a stored procedures that will display the employee details based on the given dept name.  Dept name is the input for stored procedure.   

->
USE apr2024;

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE emp_details(IN p_dept_no INT)
BEGIN 
SELECT  * FROM emps WHERE deptno=p_dept_no;
END//
DELIMITER ;

CALL emp_details(1);

3. Create stored procedures that get employees count who are having greater salary than the average of all salaries.  Return employees count  as output variable. 

->
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE getEmployeeCount(OUT employeeCount INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE averageSalary DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    -- Calculate the average salary
    SELECT AVG(salary) INTO averageSalary FROM emps;
    
    -- Get the count of employees with salary greater than the average
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO employeeCount FROM emps WHERE salary > averageSalary;
END //

DELIMITER ;

4. Create stored procedures that insert the data into emp table. Take all the required values as input parameters. 
->DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE enter_data(IN empno INT,IN ename VARCHAR(50),IN job VARCHAR(50), IN salary FLOAT,IN deptno INT)
BEGIN 
INSERT INTO emps(empno,ename,job,salary,deptno) VALUES (empno,ename,job,salary,deptno);
END //
DELIMITER ;

CALL enter_data(3,'basu','tester',30000,2);


5. Create View to return employee job and corresponding  max salary in each job.  
->
CREATE VIEW MaxSalJob AS
SELECT job, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY job;


6.  How to use distinct option in select query? 
->we can use keyword distinct in the query

SYNTAX:  SELECT DISTINCT column1
          FROM table_name;

EX:  SELECT DISTINCT department
     FROM employees;

7.Create ProductsLogs table to store the following information. 
		 Eg:	  Id, Operation, ProductId, ProductName,  Date, Time,  Message 
		
		Hint: Target the Products table.

->
  CREATE TABLE productLogTable(
    Id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    operation VARCHAR(100) ,
    productId INT,
    productName VARCHAR(50),
    date DATE,
    time TIME ,
    message TEXT);
    
    INSERT INTO productLogTable(Id,operation,productId,productName,date,time,message) 
    VALUES ('delete operation',10,'santoor',curdate(),curtime(),'data was deleted');
    
    SELECT * FROM productLogTable;


8.    Create  a AFTER INSERT trigger operation  and  insert the corresponding details ProductsLogs table. 
->
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER AfterProductInsert
AFTER INSERT ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO ProductsLogs (Operation, ProductId, ProductName, Date, Time, Message)
    VALUES ('INSERT', NEW.Id, NEW.ProductName, CURDATE(), CURTIME(), 'Product inserted');
END;
//
DELIMITER


9.  Create  a AFTER DELETE trigger operation  and  insert the corresponding details ProductsLogs table with corresponding message. 

->

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER AfterProductDelete
AFTER DELETE ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO ProductsLogs (Operation, ProductId, ProductName, Date, Time, Message)
    VALUES ('DELETE', OLD.Id, OLD.ProductName, CURDATE(), CURTIME(), 'Product deleted');
END;
//
DELIMITER
